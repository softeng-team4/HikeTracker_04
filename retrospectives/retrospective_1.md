TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 
- Total points committed vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story          | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
| -------------- | ------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ |
| _#0_           | 6       |        | 32         | 21           |
| Browse hikes   | 4       | 8      | 10         | 11.5         |
| Describe hikes | 5       | 5      | 16         | 27.83        |
| Register       | 5       | 13     | 14         | 13.33        |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
  - Estimated hours per task: 72 / 20 = 3.6
  - Actual hours per task: 73.66 / 20 = 3.683
  - Estimated standard deviation: 
  - Actual standard deviation: 
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1
  - 72 / 73.66 -1 = -0.023

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 7h
  - Total hours spent : 7h 40m
  - Nr of automated unit test cases : 
  - Coverage (if available) :
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated : 7h
  - Total hours spent : 5h 10m
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated : 8h
  - Total hours spent : 5h 10m
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
