TEMPLATE FOR RETROSPECTIVE (Team ##)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done 

7 stories committed vs. 7 stories done

- Total points committed vs. done 

47 points committed vs. 47 points done

- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team)

72h 45m planned vs. 72h 25m spent

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!)

| Define reference points | 4       | 5      | 7h 30m     | 6h 10m       |
   

> Note that issue fix and docker setup are included in story `#0`.
> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)
- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent - 1

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
  - Nr of automated unit test cases 
  - Coverage (if available)
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- Code review 
  - Total hours estimated 
  - Total hours spent
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

The late development start caused some of the horizontal tasks (especially those regarding communication) to receive less attention than originally anticipated.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

The sprint planning phase needs to be much swifter, even at the cost of some accuracy in estimation. During this sprint, the yearning for accurate estimation caused a delay of the whole development phase. This resulted in a rather rushed development and few time available for coordination activities

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

It has been made better use of some basic form of internal documentation to better define guidelines for the team to follow 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

There hasn't been a tangible improvement in the communication department, since the late start put the team into a hurry to complete the tasks defined in the planning phase.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

 - Have a quicker estimation phase in order to start the development earlier. This would give ideas more time to be properly shaped and discussed among the team and would let the team have an easier time planning coordination activities 

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!

Despite the initial problems, all the story committed at the end of the planning have been completed
